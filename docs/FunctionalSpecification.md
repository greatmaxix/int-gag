We have agrred to do a Laraval project as the first plan been seted, the first idea of the project is to create funny posts and show them on the screen also a registration and Login system with layaers of validations.

Currently we are working on the documentation which are an important part of any project at the begininng to set the ideas and the main functions what and how to implement them.

## UI plan:

The User interface won't be too compleceted, we will have a simple registration and login pages.

The dashboard will have the feed of the posts and mems that we have in the database

The project my get expended to add an admin page were an admin can manage the post's delete them approve them and update them. also an admin is allowed to manage the user table, add, delete users.

## Use Cases

The user will login in the system, and then the user will see some feed on the dashboard. the user can double click on a photo to like the photo so the user will see how many ppl liked this photo before.

- Adding a post:
the user can write a post/meme into the his own page and it will show on other users feed page.

- Admin page:
will have two taps the first one would be for the users were admin can manage the users of the system.
the seconed tap could be the posts tab were an admin can remove and add/update posts
